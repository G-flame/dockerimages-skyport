# 🚀 Docker Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Docker-based projects** designed for **Skyport** and other platforms! These projects aim to make it easier to deploy and manage services, with a focus on **Minecraft** servers and **Skyport panel** automation.

## 🛠️ Quick Installation

To get started with **Bedrock Server Docker (BSD)**, simply run the following command to install Docker and set up the container:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/g-flame/dockerimages-skyport/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/other/bedrock-server/bsd-installer.sh | bash
```

This will download and execute the **Bedrock Server Docker Installer**, which handles the entire setup process for you.
